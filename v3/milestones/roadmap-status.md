**Go/No-Go Decision**: ✅ GO -- All 19 Phase 0 gates passed (Phase 0 suite: 86 passed, 0 failed)

**Blockers**: Phase 0 无阻塞；存在跨阶段外部依赖阻塞（`tests/test_phase2_ingestion.py` 依赖 HuggingFace 模型权限，`pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` 会在收集阶段报 401）。该阻塞不影响 Phase 0 Go 判定。

## Decision Log (Resolved Questions)

This section tracks questions that have been resolved through architectural decisions.

### ✅ Resolution 1: Phase 2.1 Speaker ID Priority (2026-02-06)

**Original Question**: Is speaker identification required for MVP, or truly optional?

**Decision**: OPTIONAL - User decides after Phase 2.0 validation (Week 8)

**Rationale**:
- Speaker ID adds 2 weeks + complexity
- Value depends on use case (meetings vs solo work)
- Better to validate Phase 2.0 audio quality first

**Reference**: ADR-0004

---

### ✅ Resolution 2: P3 Memory Capability Definition (2026-02-06)

**Original Question**: What does "memory capability" (P3) actually mean?

**Decision**: A (Daily/Weekly Summaries) + C (Persistent Agent State)

**Rationale**:
- Summaries provide user value for reviewing past activity
- Agent state enables smarter chat with context memory
- Requires Phase 4 (Chat) foundation first
- Not MVP-critical, deferred to Phase 7 (Week 23+)

**Reference**: ADR-0003

---

### ✅ Resolution 3: Streaming Chat Priority (2026-02-06)

**Original Question**: Should streaming be added to Phase 4, or deferred to Phase 6+?

**Decision**: Phase 6+ (Week 21-22)

**Rationale**:
- Phase 4 delivers simple request-response first
- Streaming added in Phase 6 if on schedule

---

### ✅ Resolution 4: Execution Strategy (2026-02-06)

**Original Question**: Should Phase 3/4/5 run in parallel or serial?

**Decision**: SERIAL execution (Phase 3 → 4 → 5)

**Rationale**:
- Reduces complexity and coordination overhead
- Prioritizes stability over speed
- Timeline extends to 5 months (Week 20) - acceptable tradeoff

---

## Open Questions (Active)

✅ **All Open Questions resolved as of 2026-02-06.** (See Changelog line 374-383 for all resolved decisions)

**Review Trigger**: Add new questions here when discovered during Phase 0+ execution.

## Execution Strategy

### Serial vs Parallel Execution

**Decision**: Phase 3, Phase 4, and Phase 5 will execute SERIALLY (not in parallel).

**Rationale**:
1. **Complexity Reduction**: Eliminates resource conflicts, coordination overhead, and parallel debugging challenges
2. **Quality Focus**: Each phase can be fully validated before the next begins
3. **Single-Person Team**: Serial execution aligns better with solo development workflow
4. **Acceptable Tradeoff**: 5-month timeline (Week 20) is acceptable vs. risk of parallel execution failures

**Timeline Impact**:
- Original plan (parallel): 15 weeks
- Adjusted plan (serial): 20 weeks
- Tradeoff: +5 weeks for stability and reduced risk

**Sequence**:
```
Week 11-12: Phase 3 (Multi-Modal Search)
Week 13-15: Phase 4 (Chat Capability)
Week 16-20: Phase 5 (Deployment Migration)
```

**Cross-Phase Dependencies**:
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 completion (multi-modal search needed for chat tool)
- Phase 5 depends on Phase 4 completion (all features must work remotely, including chat)
